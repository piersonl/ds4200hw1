    <p>Hi! My name is Lon Pierson and I'm a 3rd year Honors Data Science and Math student at Northeastern University.
       I'm currently a TA for the programming with data class as well as an RA and am involved on campus through the
       campus radio station WRBB as well as in Intramural Volleyball. I'm extremely interested in machine learning
       and specifically how math can be used as a tool for creating machine learning algorithms. Outside of data science
       My interests include:</p>
